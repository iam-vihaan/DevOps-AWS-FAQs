Q1. What is Amazon CloudWatch?

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service provided by AWS that enables you to collect and track metrics, logs, and events for your AWS resources and applications. 
It helps you gain insights into the performance, operational health, and resource utilization of your AWS infrastructure and applications.


Q2. What can I use to access CloudWatch?

To access Amazon CloudWatch, you can use:

AWS Management Console: Web interface for easy access to CloudWatch features.
AWS CLI: Command-line tool to manage CloudWatch resources.
AWS SDKs: Programmatically interact with CloudWatch using SDKs for various programming languages.
Mobile App: Monitor metrics and alarms via the CloudWatch Console Mobile App.

Q3. What is Amazon CloudWatch Logs?

Amazon CloudWatch Logs is a feature of Amazon CloudWatch that enables you to collect, monitor, and store log files from your AWS resources
applications, and services in real-time.

Use Cases:

Monitor logs from web servers or applications to identify performance issues.
Set up real-time alerts for specific error patterns in logs.
Capture and analyze logs from AWS CloudTrail for user activity auditing.
Trigger Lambda functions or notifications based on log events.
Analyze application logs to identify bottlenecks and optimize resource usage.



Q4. What access management policies can I implement for CloudWatch?

For Amazon CloudWatch we can implement the following access management policies.

IAM Policies: Fine-grained permissions for CloudWatch actions (e.g., viewing logs, creating alarms).
CloudWatch Resource Policies: Grant access to specific CloudWatch resources (e.g., logs) across accounts or services.
AWS Organizations SCPs: Control permissions across your organization to manage CloudWatch access.
Logs Insights Permissions: Define permissions for running and managing queries on CloudWatch Logs.
Dashboards Permissions: Control access to creating and viewing CloudWatch Dashboards.
Alarms Permissions: Control access to managing CloudWatch Alarms.
Logs Retention Permissions: Allow managing retention policies for CloudWatch Logs.

Q5. How does Amazon CloudWatch collect data?


1. Amazon CloudWatch automatically collects metrics from many AWS services like EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda, and more. 
   These metrics are available by default, and you can monitor things like CPU utilization, memory usage, request counts, and others.

2. For logs, CloudWatch collects them from services like Lambda, EC2 instances (using the CloudWatch Logs agent), and other AWS services that generate logs

3. You can send custom application or business metrics to CloudWatch using the CloudWatch API or AWS SDK.

4. The CloudWatch Agent can be installed on EC2 instances or on-premises servers to collect additional metrics 
   (e.g., disk, memory usage) and push them to CloudWatch.


Q6. What are CloudWatch Alarms?

CloudWatch Alarms are a feature of Amazon CloudWatch that allow you to monitor specific metrics(cpu, memroy, disk, network traffic) 
logs, or events, and trigger actions when those metrics cross predefined thresholds. 
Alarms help you automatically respond to changes in your AWS environment, enabling you to take corrective actions without manual intervention.

Types of Alarms:

Threshold-based Alarms: Triggered when a metric exceeds or falls below a predefined threshold.
Anomaly Detection Alarms: Use machine learning to automatically detect deviations from normal metric patterns (e.g., unexpected spike in traffic).

Usecases:

To monitor resources like EC2 instances or databases to ensure they are performing within acceptable limits.
To detect issues like high latency or slow response times in your application by monitoring metrics like request counts or error rates.


Example:
You could create an alarm to monitor the CPU utilization of an EC2 instance:

Metric: CPU Utilization of EC2 instance.
Threshold: If CPU utilization exceeds 80% for 5 minutes.
Action: Send an alert via Amazon SNS to the operations team.
State: The alarm will go into ALARM state when the threshold is breached, and the notification is sent.


Example CLI Command to Create an Alarm:

aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --alarm-name HighCPUUtilization \
  --metric-name CPUUtilization \
  --namespace AWS/EC2 \
  --statistic Average \
  --period 300 \
  --threshold 80 \
  --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold \
  --evaluation-periods 1 \
  --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic \
  --ok-actions arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic \
  --unit Percent

Summary of the Alarm Logic:

Metric: CPU utilization of EC2 instance.
Threshold: 80% CPU utilization.
Trigger: The alarm will trigger if the CPU utilization is greater than or equal to 80% for a 5-minute(300sec) period.
Alarm Actions: Send an SNS notification to the provided topic when the alarm state is triggered (CPU utilization exceeds 80%).
OK Actions: Send a notification when the CPU utilization returns to a normal (OK) state.



Q7. Can I use CloudWatch to monitor my on-premises resources?

we can use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor our on-premises resources by using the CloudWatch Agent. 
This allows us to send custom metrics and log data from your on-premises servers (or any infrastructure not hosted in AWS) to CloudWatch for centralized monitoring.

Below are the steps to configure it:

Install the CloudWatch Agent on your on-premises server (Linux/Windows).
Configure the agent to collect metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, disk) and logs (e.g., system/application logs).
The agent sends data to CloudWatch Metrics and CloudWatch Logs.
Use CloudWatch to monitor, create alarms, and visualize data.

Example for linux server:

1. Install the CloudWatch Agent

sudo apt-get install amazon-cloudwatch-agent

2. Configure the CloudWatch Agent

sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard

3. Start the CloudWatch Agent

sudo systemctl start amazon-cloudwatch-agent

4. Verify Data in CloudWatch under metrics and logs section



Q8. What is CloudWatch Events?

Amazon CloudWatch Events (now called Amazon EventBridge) is a fully managed service that enables you to respond to changes in your AWS environment 
by automatically triggering actions based on specific events.

Below are some examples of events:

1. EC2 State Change: Trigger an SNS notification when an EC2 instance is stopped.
2. S3 Object Created: Invoke a Lambda function when an object is uploaded to an S3 bucket.
3. IAM Policy Change: Trigger an SNS notification on changes to IAM policies.
4. Auto Scaling Action: Notify when an Auto Scaling group scales in or out.
5. ECS Task State Change: Trigger a process if an ECS task fails.
6. SNS Message Sent: Trigger a Lambda function on a specific SNS message.


Q9. How long does CloudWatch retain data?


Amazon CloudWatch retains data for the following durations:

Metrics:
High-resolution metrics (1-second granularity) are stored for 3 hours.

Standard-resolution metrics (1-minute granularity) are stored for:
15 days for 1-minute data.
63 days for 5-minute data.
455 days for 1-hour data.

Logs:
CloudWatch Logs retention can be configured by the user. By default, logs are retained indefinitely
but you can set a retention period ranging from 1 day to 10 years.


Alarms:
Alarms remain active until you delete them. They don't have a data retention period but trigger based on the metrics they monitor.



Q10. What are best practices for using AWS CloudWatch effectively?

Set Alarms: Monitor key metrics and trigger actions.
Use Granular Metrics: Enable high-resolution for detailed monitoring.
Organize Logs: Create log groups and streams for better management.
Set Retention Policies: Control log storage costs.
Enable Detailed Monitoring: For EC2 and critical resources.
Use Logs Insights: Analyze log data effectively.
Monitor Custom Metrics: Track app and business-specific data.
Automate with Events: Automate actions via CloudWatch Events.
Tag Resources: For better tracking and cost management.
Optimize Costs: Review metrics and logs regularly to minimize unnecessary costs.
